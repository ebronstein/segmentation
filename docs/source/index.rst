Berkeley AutoLab Segmentation Documentation
===========================================
Welcome to the documentation for the Berkeley AutoLab's `segmentation` module!
This module is used for segmenting 3D meshes into parts and comparing those
parts using their D2 shape descriptors.

The `segmentation` module depends directly on AutoLab's `meshpy` and
`visualization` modules.
